# Physics Odyssey
As a bored physics student seeking to ignite my passion for physics, I have decided to embark on a challenge that involves solving 100 new problems over the next 100 days. Not only will I delve into the internal physics of each problem, but I will also perform numerical simulations to enhance my understanding. Every day, I will update the readme file and commit a new file to the repository, documenting my progress and findings.
