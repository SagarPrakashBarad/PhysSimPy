# Physics Odyssey
As a bored physics student seeking to ignite my passion for physics, I have decided to take on a challenge that involves solving 100 new problems over the next 100 days. Not only will I read into the internal physics of each problem, but I will also perform numerical simulations for the systems. Every day, I will update the readme file and commit a new file to the repository, documenting my progress and findings.

## Day 1: Monte Carlo Metropolis Simulation of 2D Ising Model [CPU only]
The paper followed: Testing Lorentz Invariance Emergence in the Ising Model using Monte Carlo simulations
- Author(s): Dias A., María I.
- Supervisors: Krstić Marinković, Marina; Blas, Diego
- Publication Type: [CERN Summer Student Report](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2280218/files/cern-summer-student.pdf)

## Day 2: Mechanical Motion Solver
Studied the dynamics of pendulum, parabolic, and tautochrone motion using Lagrangian mechanics.

## Day 3: Monte Carlo Metrolpolis Simulation of 3D Ising Model [GPU only}
The paper followed : "What does it take to solve the 3D Ising model? Minimal necessary conditions for a valid solution"
- Authors: G. M. Viswanathan, M. A. G. Portillo, E. P. Raposo, M. G. E. da Luz
- Paper: [cond-mat.stat-mech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12357)
